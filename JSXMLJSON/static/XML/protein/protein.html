        FUNCTION: IN MOUSE THERE ARE TWO CLASSES OF
          HIGH-AFFINITY IL-3 RECEPTORS. ONE CONTAINS THIS IL-3-
          SPECIFIC BETA CHAIN AND THE OTHER CONTAINS THE BETA
          CHAIN ALSO SHARED BY HIGH-AFFINITY IL-5 AND GM-CSF
          RECEPTORS.
        SUBUNIT: Heterodimer of an alpha
        and a beta chain.
        SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Type I
        membrane protein.
        SIMILARITY: BELONGS TO THE CYTOKINE
        FAMILY OF RECEPTORS.
